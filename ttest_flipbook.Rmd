### We will start with the tidy version from the {infer} package: t_test()

#### Notice that you have to state the order of the two levels of your grouping variable
---

```{r ttest1, include = FALSE}
prostate %>%
  t_test(TVol ~ AA, 
         order = c("0", "1"))
# Interpreting the results
# The t statistic is first
# followed by degrees of freedom
# then the p value
# the default alternative: two.sided
# then the confidence bounds
# output is a tibble so that it is 
# easy to use these results
```

`r chunk_reveal("ttest1", break_type = "auto", title = "Tidy version from the {infer} package")`


---

### Now we will use the baseR version: t.test()

#### Notice that you have to use   `data = .`
#### It is not quite as pipe-friendly
#### But you do not have to specify the order of the two levels.
---

```{r ttest2, include = FALSE}
prostate %>%
  t.test(TVol ~ AA, data = .)

# Interpreting the results
# The t statistic is first
# followed by degrees of freedom
# then the p value
# then the alternative hypothesis
# then the confidence bounds
# then the mean mpg for each group
```

`r chunk_reveal("ttest2", break_type = "auto", title = "Base R Version")`

```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 80%}
```

### Which version of the t test do you like better?
