### How to Use Filters to Pick Out String Values

#### Leaning on the {stringr} package

Format: <br>

dataset %>% 
  filter(variable == "string"))
  
OR

dataset %>% 
  filter(str_detect(variable, "string"))
  
The _str_detect()_ function returns either a TRUE or FALSE for each row in the dataset - a **logical vector**. <br>
The filter function **acts** on this logical vector to filter out rows that are FALSE for your logical statement.
It is a common mistake to rely on str_detect alone, but it won't filter your rows. You need **both** filter and str_detect to get this done.

We will use the CMV dataset, which looks at bone marrow transplantation for a variety of cancers. 

Let's look at some filter examples!

---

```{r filter1, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# how many rows when you start
nrow(cmv) 

cmv %>% 
# selected 3 columns
# see how diagnosis changes w/filter
  select(age, sex, diagnosis) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(diagnosis, "oma"))

# see how many rows now
# check diagnosis
# Format:
# filter(str_detect(variable,"string"))        <br>  


```

`r chunk_reveal("filter1", 
    break_type = "auto", 
    title = "Example 1/5:  Filter Rows with str_detect on Character Variables")`

---

```{r filter2, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# how many rows when you start
nrow(cmv) 

cmv %>% 
# selected 3 columns
# see how diagnosis changes w/filter
  select(age, race, diagnosis) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(diagnosis, 
        pattern =  "Hodgkin"))

# see how many rows now
# check diagnosis
# Format:
# filter(str_detect(variable,"string"))        <br>  


```

`r chunk_reveal("filter2", 
    break_type = "auto", 
    title = "Example 2/5: Filter Not-Rows (! Negation) with str_detect on Character Variables")`

---

```{r filter3, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# how many rows when you start
nrow(cmv) 

cmv %>% 
# selected 3 columns
# see how diagnosis changes w/filter
  select(sex, race, diagnosis) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(diagnosis,
        pattern = "lympho.+ic"))

# see how many rows now
# check diagnosis
# Format:
# filter(str_detect(variable,"string"))        <br>  


```

`r chunk_reveal("filter3", 
    break_type = "auto", 
    title = "Example 3/5: Filter Rows with a Little Bit of Regex<br>.+ means any character from 1 to N times")`

---

```{r filter4, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# how many rows when you start
nrow(cmv) 

cmv %>% 
# selected 3 columns
# see how diagnosis changes w/filter
  select(sex, race, diagnosis) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(diagnosis, "myelo.*"))

# see how many rows now
# check diagnosis

# selected 3 columns

  filter(diagnosis == "myelofibrosis")

# see how many rows now
# check diagnosis
# Format:
# filter(variable == "string")        <br>  


```
